            responsibilities include designing, architecting, and developing SaaS solutions for advocacy and digital

            experience in building and managing software products across social, web, mobile, desktop, and cloud

            certifications, including Microsoft Certified Azure Developer, Microsoft Certified Azure AI Associate, and
